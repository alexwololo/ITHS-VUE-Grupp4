## LANDING PAGE (HomeView.vue)

> > View components

- SignInView.vue
- SignUpView.vue
- ProductsView.vue
- SupportView.vue
- BlablaView.vue

> > Other components

- Header.vue (might be a good idea to make two versions of the header component, one for when the user isn't logged in and one for when the user is).
- Footer.vue

All these components make up the HomeView.vue view component.

## ISSUES

- There's 4 cards in the To do list in GitHub that are sort of the same: "component view landingpage", "landing?", "home view", "component view startingpage".

- Clean up To do list.

## UPDATES

- Added the following view components: ProductsView.vue, SignInView.vue, SignUpView.vue, SupportView.vue, BlablaView.vue.
- Changes in router.js to contain the routes to the new view components.
